# Comparator

This project mostly exists as a toy project to gain experience in using
Elixir + Phoenix, plus various webby things I don't get a chance to use
in my day job.

Almost as a side effect it will also provide a tool to allow tracking
personal reviews of things, because I'm a bit sick of "what do I think
of that takeaway/film/tourist destination" being held and displayed at
the whim of companies. I want to be able to look up what I thought of
a place easily, and maybe make a top 10 list or something.
